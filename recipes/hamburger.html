    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This grilled hamburger recipe is a classic favorite that's perfect for summer barbecues or casual dinners. Juicy and flavorful, these burgers are easy to make and can be customized with your favorite toppings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>Optional toppings: lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, gently mix the ground beef with salt and pepper. Be careful not to overwork the meat to keep the burgers tender.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a patty about 3/4 inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty to prevent it from puffing up during cooking.</li>
        <li>Place the patties on the preheated grill. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on one side, then flip and cook for another 4-5 minutes on the other side for medium doneness. Adjust cooking time if you prefer your burgers more or less cooked.</li>
        <li>If you're adding cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking and close the grill lid to melt the cheese.</li>
        <li>Remove the patties from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Toast the hamburger buns on the grill for about 1 minute until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Assemble your burgers by placing each patty on a bun and adding your favorite toppings. Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious grilled hamburgers!</li>
    </ol>
