    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cooked rice (preferably day-old)</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked chicken, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>

        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: sliced green onions for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the beaten eggs and scramble until fully cooked. Remove the eggs from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil to the skillet. Saut√© the chopped onion and minced garlic until fragrant and translucent, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the diced cooked chicken to the skillet and cook for another 2-3 minutes until heated through.</li>
        <li>Add the frozen peas and carrots to the skillet and cook for an additional 2 minutes until they are tender.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked rice to the skillet, breaking up any clumps with a spatula. Stir everything together to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour the soy sauce over the rice mixture and stir well to evenly distribute the sauce. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the rice to slightly crisp up on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Return the scrambled eggs to the skillet and mix them into the rice. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and garnish with sliced green onions if desired. Serve hot and enjoy your homemade chicken fried rice!</li>
